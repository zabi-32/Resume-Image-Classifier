## Project Overview

Welcome to the Resume Image Classifier project! This project focuses on classifying resume images into relevant and non-relevant categories using machine learning. The dataset used in this project comprises images of resumes, and the goal is to build a classifier that can identify whether a given image contains a resume or not.

## About the Project

The Resume Image Classifier project aims to automate the process of identifying resumes within images. This can be beneficial for various applications, including resume screening and document management.

## Introduction

Resumes are essential documents in the hiring process, and automating the identification of resumes from images can save time and streamline workflows. This project employs machine learning techniques to create a classifier capable of distinguishing between images that contain resumes and those that do not.

## Model Development

The project involves the development of a machine-learning model using a dataset of labeled resume and non-resume images. Different algorithms and architectures may be explored to achieve the best classification performance.

## How to Use the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Resume-Image-Classifier.git
   cd Resume-Image-Classifier
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the notebook, model metrics, and documentation in the `Resume Image Classifier` directory.
